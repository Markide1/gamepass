# gamepass
This game system has a fun idea: if you accidentally use someone else's password when logging in, it gives you a hint by showing their email. 
It might say, "You entered [user's] password, maybe your email is [user's email]?" 
This adds a playful twist to the normal way of logging in, making it feel like a guessing game. 
Do you think you're good at guessing passwords?
